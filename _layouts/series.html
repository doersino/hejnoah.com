            <p>Databases are commonly used as dumb storage bins for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> application data. However, this doesn’t do them justice: database systems such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">PostgreSQL</a> are much more capable and versatile than that, supporting a wide range of operations across <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/datatype.html">many different data types</a>.</p> <p>The standard way of interfacing with Postgres is SQL – you know, that thing you may have briefly learned in webdev class where you <code class="highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> stuff <code class="highlighter-rouge">FROM</code> a set of tables <code class="highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> some condition is met. But that’s a far cry from what you can achieve when taking advantage of the full feature set of this declarative and – surprise! – <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7580013">Turing complete</a> programming language.</p> <p><em>This series of posts is loosely based on what I learned in the <a href="http://db.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/AdvancedSQLSS2017.html">Advanced SQL lecture held by Torsten Grust in the summer of 2017</a> at the University of Tübingen. Take a look at the <a href="http://db.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/AdvancedSQLSS2017.html">lecture slides</a> for in-depth explanations and a wide array of examples.</em></p>
